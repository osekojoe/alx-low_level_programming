- This project explores recursion in C
0. a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
1. a function that prints a string in reverse.
2. a function that returns the length of a string.
3. a function that returns the factorial of a given number.
4. a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
	- If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1
5. a function that returns the natural square root of a number.
	- If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1
6. a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
7. a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
	- An empty string is a palindrome
8. a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered
	identical, otherwise return 0.
	- s2 can contain the special character *.
	- The special char * can replace any string (including an empty string)
