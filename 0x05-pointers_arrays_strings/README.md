- This project explores pointers, arrays and strings in c
0. a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98
1. a function that swaps the values of two integers.
2. a function that returns the length of a string.
3. a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
4. a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
5. a function that reverses a string.
6. a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new 	line.
7. a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line
	- The function should print the second half of the string
	- If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where 		n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2
8. a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
	- where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed
	- Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
	- The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array
9. a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer 
	pointed to by dest.
	- Return value: the pointer to dest
10. a function that convert a string to an integer.
	- The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters
	- You need to take into account all the - and + signs before the number
	- If there are no numbers in the string, the function must return 0
	- You are not allowed to use long
	- You are not allowed to declare new variables of “type” array
	- You are not allowed to hard-code special values
11. a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.
